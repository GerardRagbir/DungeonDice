# A Dungeons & Dragons Dice CLI
<h4>Created by Gerard Ragbir</h4>

As a huge D&D fan, I thought it would be a unique opportunity to write a CLI in Dart for some good ole dice rolling!

Commands Available:
 - [X] All dice rolls available (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100) 
 - [X] Messages and Options can be added, or changed in the 'helpers' folder
 - [] Add options for rolling with advantage/disadvantage ('--a' and '--d')
