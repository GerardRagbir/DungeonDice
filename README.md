# A Dungeons & Dragons Dice CLI

<h4>Created by Gerard Ragbir</h4>

As a D&D fan, I thought it would be a unique opportunity to write a CLI in Dart for some good ole dice rolling!

Commands Available:

- [X] All dice rolls available (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100)
- [X] Messages and Options can be added, or changed in the 'helpers' folder
- [ ] Add options for rolling with advantage/disadvantage ('--a' and '--d')
- [ ] Add test cases


Fixes:

- [X] Random number generator did not account for returning the integer "0"
- [X] Rolled back V2 changes due to instability in the main thread.
